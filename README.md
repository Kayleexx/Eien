# Eien

Eien is an interactive, physics-based visualization project built in **Rust** using [nannou](https://nannou.cc/). The project features bouncing balls with elastic collisions, mouse interaction, and a foundation for creative generative art.

---

## Features (Phase 1 Completed)

- Bouncing balls with mass and elastic collisions.
- Mouse interaction:
  - Drag balls around.
  - Left-click to spawn new balls.
- Basic physics simulation with wall collisions.
- Clean, minimal visual style.

---

## Roadmap / Upcoming Phases

### Phase 2 – Mathematical Art
- Implement Mandelbrot & Julia sets.
- L-systems for organic patterns.
- Use iterators efficiently for sequences.
> *(This phase is untouched so far.)*

### Phase 3 – Performance & Polish
- Multi-threading for heavy computations (fractals).
- Real-time interactive controls.
- Image export and animations.
- Rust optimization using zero-cost abstractions.

### Phase 4 – Advanced Features
- Procedural landscapes and textures.
- Audio-reactive visuals.
- 3D fractals.
- Custom shaders for advanced visuals.
